        <p>IF you don't know how to code HTML, here is how to code summarised></p>
        <p>You start with two html tags. You then have two head tags and two title tags and then write down the name of your article.</p>
        <p>Next, you close off the head tag with the same tag with a slash and make a body tag.</p>
        <p>You put in h1 because it is the size of the heading of the page. There are sizes ranging from h1 to h6, but we need h1 because it is the main header</p>
        <p>You use the p tag to write down your information.</p>
